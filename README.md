As seen in the image above, there appears to be significant bias regarding payment for music. It seems that a unanimous majority of customers prefer to not pay for music products (e.g. prefer to stream their music for free) and seem to have an overwhelming bias on music. A suggestion of increasing the price and advertise that free music streaming is included on paid memberships may increase sway the bias of this analysis. Further analysis regrading the type of genre of music may be needed to see where the bias lies, however music is of course a personal preference based on the user therefore it is expected to still see significant bias regardless of the genre of music.
